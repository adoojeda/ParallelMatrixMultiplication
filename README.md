# Matrix Multiplication Benchmarking and Implementation Comparison

This project conducts a performance analysis by comparing different matrix multiplication implementations in terms of execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption. The evaluated implementations are:

- **Basic Implementation**
- **Parallel Implementation (using multiple threads)**
- **Vectorized Implementation**

## Objectives

- Compare the implementations based on different matrix sizes.
- Measure performance in terms of time, CPU, and memory usage.
- Evaluate the efficiency of parallel and vectorized implementations.
- Speedup compared to the basic algorithm.
- Efficiency of parallel execution
